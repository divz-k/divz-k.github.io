This is some **emphasised** and _italicised_ text.

## About Me
Hi! I’m a computational and molecular biology PhD student at the Weizmann Institute, Israel. I’ve spent the last few years diving deep into sequencing data and conducting large-scale, high-throughput experiments to acquire it. I enjoy working with big data and finding simple, effective ways to communicate those insights.

## Academic Journey
I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science, where I majored in Biology. I then moved to Israel to do my Masters at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I later continued for my PhD.
